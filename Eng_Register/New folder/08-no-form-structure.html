                            <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
                            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                            versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                            <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
                            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
                            page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                            more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                            here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
                            editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
                            uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
                            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                            <p>
                                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                                of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
                                a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                                Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                                word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                                sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
                                Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                                popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
                                amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
                                interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
                                also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
                                translation by H. Rackham.
